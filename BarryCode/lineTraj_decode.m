%LINETRAJDECODE Find best straight trajectory through postprob matrix
% Decoder returns a posterior probability matrix [pos bins [1cm] by time
% bins [1ms], typically [100,300] i.e. 100cm by 300ms]. Each bin is the
% prob the rat was at that pos at that time. Goal is to find the best
% constant speed trajactory (straight line) path through this matrix i.e.
% the line that is highest probability.
%
% Based on fast_best_line.m in FO_biased_replay writen orginally for the
% biased replay paper but not used
%
% Method is simple - for a given line sum the prob in the bins within a
% certain distance of the line (can be graded - see below), then
% iterate for different lines and find the
% one that includes the highest sum (actually mean) probability.
%
% Implementation is done with il_filter2 for speed - allows all offsets for a
% given line gradient to be tested at the same time. Note only lines of a
% given range of gradient are tested and only certain offsets are valid. A
% final criteria is that lines must include sufficient bins to be
% considered trustworthy (i.e. don't accept lines that just 'clip' the
% postProb matrix).
%
% DEFINING ROI AROUND LINE
% See inline function (around line 220) for code that defines the line with
% ROI - this can either be a hard cut off or graded. If the latter then the
% yRange needs to be large (100). Comment lines to change behaviour.
%
% RETURNED RESIDUAL
% This is the bit that has changed from fast_best_line.m Really want to
% know of all the variability in the pMat how much is the line explaining
% (i.e. how much does the ROI cover - needs to be weighted by the ROI if
% not a hard cut off I think)

%                   for each time bin the prob animal is at given point.
%                   Columns should sum to 1. [nPosBin x nTimeBin].

% RETURNS
% bstRes            residual or probability of best fit line. Basically the

%

%
% bstYInt           yIntercept of best fit line (see fitLine_CB2) but
%                   basically is posBin of intercept
%
%
% bstTstLnBnd       The line mask for pMat that gives the best residual
%                   i.e. using this as a logical mask of pMat will pull out
%                   all bins that contribute to the residual
% e.g.

% Now loop over each gradient to test and in each loop test all possible

    %Main step is to calculate the sum of pMat bins that overlap with a

    %line and the band around it as a mat.
    
    
    %Use an  function to define the line - partly to keep code tiday
    %and because it's called in multiple places. The two mats returned are

    %Now do the main step - use il_filter2 to convolve the tstLn with the pMat

%gave the best fit i.e. the value of the fit, the gradient and intercept.

%NL. bestRes is the highest mean prob per bin of the overlap between pMat
%and line found. tmpInd is the index into meanP (i.e. loop index) that gave
%this result. Normalise the prob explained by the total amount of prop to
%make it more meaningful.

%Offset is harder to understand - first thing to remember is that
%co-ordinate system is -1 from the bin subscript (i.e the first x bin is
%equivalent to x=0 and same for y). The offset is related to the value of
%the convolution that gives the highest overlap between pMat and mask but
%is complicated by the fact that both the pMat and the mask are padded (and
%the mask can have a postive or negative gradient)

%above

%from the convolution since bin 1 is actually equivalent to lag of 0 and we
%have -1 from converstion between matrix coor and real coord.
