%LINETRAJ_REGET_LNBND Regenerate line band to compare with other pMat
% As part of control process for grid-pc replay project want to compare
% best line mask from one pMat with others to measure 'chance'. Other pMats
% from the same experiment will have the same number of spatial bins (dim1)
% but can have different temporal lengths (dim2) so can't just use the line
% mask returned by lineTraj_decode.
%
% ARGS
% pMatSz        [1x2] Size of target pMat
%
% spd           gradient of line to build defined in terms of sBins per
%               tBin (dim1 of the pMat being spatial and dim2 time)
%
% yInterc       yIntercept of best fit line (returned by lineTraj_decode)
%               basically is posBin of intercept
%
% yRange        Define size of 'band' around line that is used to 
%               calculated it's goodness of fit. This value should be an 
%               integer and indicates the number of bins above and below 
%               (in the y-axis). Should match the value used in
%               lineTraj_decode
