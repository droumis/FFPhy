% Returns a list of numbers, one per time interval bracketed by exlude periods,
% of the number of times in each included period.

% ExcludePeriods is an n by 2 matrix where the columns are the start and end 
% times for each exclusion period.
% 
% includeStartEnd is 0 if the exclude periods begin and end at the beginning
% and end of the recording period, in which case we don't include the times
% before the first exclude time or after the last time. A value of 1 indicates
% that we should include those times.
