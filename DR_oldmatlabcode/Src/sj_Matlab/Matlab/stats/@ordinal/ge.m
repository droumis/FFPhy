function t = ge(a,b)
%GE Greater than or equal to for ordinal arrays.
%   TF = GE(A,B) returns a logical array the same size as the ordinal arrays A
%   and B, containing true (1) where the elements of A are greater than or
%   equal to those of B, and false (0) otherwise.  A and B must have the same
%   sets of ordinal levels, including their order.
%
%   TF = GE(A,S) or TF = GE(S,B), where S is a character string, returns a
%   logical array the same size as A or B, containing true (1) where the
%   elements of A or B have levels that are greater than or equal to the level
%   that has label equal to S.  S must be the label for one of the levels of A
%   or B.
%
%   Elements with undefined levels are not considered greater than or equal to
%   any other elements, including each other.
