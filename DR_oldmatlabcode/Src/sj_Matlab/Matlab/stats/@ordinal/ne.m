function t = ne(a,b)
%NE Not equal for ordinal arrays.
%   TF = NE(A,B) returns a logical array the same size as the ordinal arrays A
%   and B, containing true (1) where the corresponding elements of A and B are
%   not equal, and false (0) otherwise.  A and B must have the same sets of
%   ordinal levels, including their order.
%
%   TF = NE(A,S) or TF = NE(S,B), where S is a character string, returns a
%   logical array the same size as A or B, containing true (1) where the
%   elements of A or B have levels whose labels are not equal to S.
%
%   Elements with undefined levels are considered not equal to any other
%   elements, including each other.
