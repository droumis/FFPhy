%INTERSECT Set intersection for categorical arrays.
%   C = INTERSECT(A,B) when A and B are categorical arrays returns a
%   categorical vector C containing the values common to both A and B. The
%   result C is sorted. The set of categorical levels for C is the sorted
%   union of the sets of levels of the inputs, as determined by their labels.
%   
%   [C,IA,IB] = UNION(A,B) also returns index vectors IA and IB such that
%   C = A(IA) and C = B(IB).
