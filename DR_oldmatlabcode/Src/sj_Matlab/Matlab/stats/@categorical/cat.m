%CAT Concatenate categorical arrays.
%   C = CAT(DIM, A, B, ...) concatenates the categorical arrays A, B, ...
%   along dimension DIM.  All inputs must have the same size except along
%   dimension DIM.  The set of categorical levels for C is the sorted union of
%   the sets of levels of the inputs, as determined by their labels.
