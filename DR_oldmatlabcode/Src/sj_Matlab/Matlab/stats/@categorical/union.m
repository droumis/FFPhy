%UNION Set union for categorical arrays.
%   C = UNION(A,B) when A and B are categorical arrays returns a categorical
%   vector C containing the combined values from A and B but with no
%   repetitions. The result C is sorted. The set of categorical levels for C
%   is the sorted union of the sets of levels of the inputs, as determined by
%   their labels.
%   
%   [C,IA,IB] = UNION(A,B) also returns index vectors IA and IB such that C is
%   a sorted combination of the elements A(IA) and B(IB).
