% Unlike in the usual regression model when we would like the residual

%
% To create this model, we want to write an anonymous function |f| to

%     Yfit(t) = rho*Y(t-1) + (X(t,:) - rho*X(t-1,:))*b
%
% In this anonymous function we combine |[rho; b]| into a single parameter

%% Summary
% This demo provides an illustration of how to use the MATLAB timeseries
% object along with features from the Statistics Toolbox.  It is simple to
% use the |ts.data| notation to extract the data and supply it as input to
% any Statistics Toolbox function.  A few functions (|xbarplot|, |schart|,
% and |ewmaplot|) accept time series objects directly.
%
% More elaborate analyses are possible by using features specifically
% designed for time series, such as those in the GARCH Toolbox and the
% System Identification Toolbox.
