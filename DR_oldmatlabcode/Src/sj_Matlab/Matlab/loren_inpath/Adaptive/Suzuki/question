How are things going?
Everything is looking pretty good with your algorithm and we got things 
working pretty well.
I just have two questions: due to the catch up with the learning rate on 
the first trials, i get some weird FR level on the first trial for some 
conditions for some cells. this is a problem sometimes as it changes the 
direction of a change. can you check out a file for me: it is the file 
'a080901.5'. For condition 554, the estimated starting FR  for scene-base 
is around 25Hz, although the actual scene minus baseline FR is around 0. 
same thing happens for conditions 551, 553. do you have any suggestion on 
what should be done?
should we replace the first estimations by actual real FR?
any suggestions would be great.
