function bursts = measure_bursts(timestamp,timerange,threshold);
%MEASURE_BURSTS Identify bursts of a point process.
%
%   BURSTS = MEASURE_BURSTS(TIMESTAMP,TIMERANGE,THRESHOLD) computes various
%   measures related to the inter-event intervals of the point process events
%   with times TIMESTAMP observed during the time intervals given by TIMERANGE.
%
%   TIMESTAMP is a vector of real uint32 timestamps.
%
%   TIMERANGE is a set of uint32 time intervals (of the type validated by
%   IS_TIMERANGE). All event times in TIMESTAMP must lie within TIMERANGE.
%
%   THRESHOLD is a positive real scalar parameter; successive events which occur
%   less than THRESHOLD seconds apart are grouped together as bursts. A value of
%   6 ms is hisorically used to detect complex spikes of principal neurons in
%   hippocampus (Ranck, 1973). Larger values (e.g. 15 ms) detect "pseudo-bursts"
%   (Harris et al., 2001).
%
%   BURSTS is a vector of the same size as TIMESTAMP in which each element is
%   labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, ... or NaN. 0 values indicate single events not
%   associated with a burst. 1, 2, 3, etc. values indicate the first, second,
%   third, etc. event within a burst. NaN indicates events that can not be
%   unambiguously determined (usually due to edge censoring at the start or end
%   of a time interval).
