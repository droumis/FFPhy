function automatically_assign(self)
% method to perform automatic assignments of position_data

% Prediction model:
%   dist: separation between the front and back
%   theta: orientation of the line segment between front and back
%   x, y: location of the midpoint between front and back
%   u, v: velocity of the midpoint
%
%   dist changes according to a censored Wiener process, where the change in
%   dist over timestep delta_t is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with
%   zero mean and variance equal to dist_var*delta_t, censoring dist so that it
%   is bounded between zero and dist_max. We need to estimate the parameters
%   var_scale and dist_max.
%
%   theta changes according to a circular Wiener process, where the change in
%   theta over timestamp delta_t is drawn from a von Misees distribution with
%   zero mean and kappa of the following form: 
%     kappa(delta_t, dist) = kappa_0/delta_t * (1 - exp(-dist/dist_scale))
%   We need to estimate the parameters kappa_baseline and dist_scale.
%
%   u and v change according to a Wiener process, where the change in velocity
%   over timestep delta_t is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean
%   and co-variance equal to speed_var*delta_t * eye(2).
%
%   x and y are computed by simply multiplying u and v by delta_t. u and v are
%   computed from nearby x and y by boxcar average of diffs between assigned
%   positions within some small window of duration time_window.
%
%   params:
%     dist_var, dist_max, kappa_0, dist_scale, speed_var, time_window
