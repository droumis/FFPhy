% Computes the excess correlation of the crosscorrelation histogram as follows:
% The histogram is normalized by sqrt(nspikes1 * nspikes2).  It is then 
% smoothed, first using a gaussian with stdev smoothingwidth1, and separately
% using a gaussian with stdev smoothingwidth2.
% The excess correlation is defined as the difference the two smoothed
% normalized histogram (width1 smoothed - width2 smoothed) at zero lag.

% normalize the cross correlegram

    % this occurs when there is no data, so we return NaN
