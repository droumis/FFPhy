         <h1>Modelling Data with the Generalized Extreme Value Distribution</h1>
         <introduction>
            <p>Extreme value theory is used to model the largest (or smallest) value from a group or block of measurements.  Three types
               of extreme value distributions are common, each as the limiting case for different types of underlying distributions.  For
               example, the type I extreme value is the limit distribution of the maximum (or minimum) of a block of normally distributed
               data, as the block size becomes large.
            </p>
            <p>In this example, we'll demonstrate how to fit such data using a single distribution that includes all three types of extreme
               value distributions as special cases, and investigate likelihood-based confidence intervals for quantiles of the fitted distribution.
            </p>

         <h2>The Generalized Extreme Value Distribution<a name="1"></a></h2>
         <p>The Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution unites the type I, type II, and type III extreme value distributions into
            a single family, to allow a continuous range of possible shapes.  It is parameterized with location and scale parameters,
            mu and sigma, and a shape parameter, k.  When k &lt; 0, the GEV is equivalent to the type III extreme value.  When k &gt; 0, the
            GEV is equivalent to the type II.  In the limit as k approaches 0, the GEV becomes the type I.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">x = linspace(-3,6,1000);

legend({<span class="string">'k &lt; 0, Type III'</span> <span class="string">'k = 0, Type I'</span> <span class="string">'k &gt; 0, Type II'</span>});
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="gevdemo_01.png"> <p>Notice that for k &lt; 0 or k &gt; 0, the density has zero probability above or below, respectively, the upper or lower bound -(1/k).
             In the limit as k approaches 0, the GEV is unbounded.  This can be summarized as the constraint that 1+k*(y-mu)/sigma must
            be positive.
         </p>
         <h2>Simulating Block Maximum Data<a name="3"></a></h2>
         <p>The GEV can be defined constructively as the limiting distribution of block maxima (or minima).  That is, if you generate
            a large number of independent random values from a single probability distribution, and take their maximum value, the distribution
            of that maximum is approximately a GEV.
         </p>
         <p>The original distribution determines the shape parameter, k, of the resulting GEV distribution.  Distributions whose tails
            fall off as a polynomial, such as Student's t, lead to a positive shape parameter. Distributions whose tails decrease exponentially,
            such as the normal, correspond to a zero shape parameter.  Distributions with finite tails, such as the beta, correspond to
            a negative shape parameter.
         </p>
         <p>Real applications for the GEV might include modelling the largest return for a stock during each month.  Here, we will simulate
            data by taking the maximum of 25 values from a Student's t distribution with two degrees of freedom.  The simulated data will
            include 75 random block maximum values.

         <p>The function <tt>gevfit</tt> returns both maximum likelihood parameter estimates, and (by default) 95% confidence intervals.

            not a good model for these data.  That makes sense, because the underlying distribution for the simulation had much heavier
            tails than a normal, and the type II extreme value distribution is theoretically the correct one as the block size becomes
            large.
         </p>
         <p>As an alternative to confidence intervals, we can also compute an approximation to the asymptotic covariance matrix of the
            parameter estimates, and from that extract the parameter standard errors.

         </p>
         <p>The support of the GEV depends on the parameter values.  In this case, the estimate for k is positive, so the fitted distribution

         <p>While the parameter estimates may be important by themselves, a quantile of the fitted GEV model is often the quantity of
            interest in analyzing block maxima data.
         </p>
         <p>For example, the return level Rm is defined as the block maximum value expected to be exceeded only once in m blocks.  That
            is just the (1-1/m)'th quantile. We can plug the maximum likelihood parameter estimates into the inverse CDF to estimate Rm
            for m=10.

</pre><p>We could compute confidence limits for R10 using asymptotic approximations, but those may not be valid.  Instead, we will
            use a likelihood-based method to compute confidence limits.  This method often produces more accurate results than one based
            on the estimated covariance matrix of the parameter estimates.
         </p>
         <p>Given any set of values for the parameters mu, sigma, and k, we can compute a log-likelihood -- for example, the MLEs are
            the parameter values that maximize the GEV log-likelihood.  As the parameter values move away from the MLEs, their log-likelihood
            typically becomes significantly less than the maximum.  If we look at the set of parameter values that produce a log-likelihood
            larger than a specified critical value, this is a complicated region in the parameter space.  However, for a suitable critical
            value, it is a confidence region for the model parameters.  The region contains parameter values that are "compatible with
            the data".  The critical value that determines the region is based on a chi-square approximation, and we'll use 95% as our
            confidence level.  (Note that we will actually work with the negative of the log-likelihood.)

</pre><p>For any set of parameter values mu, sigma, and k, we can compute R10. Therefore, we can find the smallest R10 value achieved
            within the critical region of the parameter space where the negative log-likelihood is larger than the critical value.  That
            smallest value is the lower likelihood-based confidence limit for R10.

         <p>This is difficult to visualize in all three parameter dimensions, but as a thought experiment, we can fix the shape parameter,

%% The Generalized Extreme Value Distribution
% The Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution unites the type I, type II,
% and type III extreme value distributions into a single family, to allow a
% continuous range of possible shapes.  It is parameterized with location and
% scale parameters, mu and sigma, and a shape parameter, k.  When k < 0, the
% GEV is equivalent to the type III extreme value.  When k > 0, the GEV is
% equivalent to the type II.  In the limit as k approaches 0, the GEV becomes
% the type I.
x = linspace(-3,6,1000);

xlabel('(x-mu) / sigma'); ylabel('Probability Density');
legend({'k < 0, Type III' 'k = 0, Type I' 'k > 0, Type II'});
%%
% Notice that for k < 0 or k > 0, the density has zero probability above or
% below, respectively, the upper or lower bound -(1/k).  In the limit as k
% approaches 0, the GEV is unbounded.  This can be summarized as the
% constraint that 1+k*(y-mu)/sigma must be positive.


%% Simulating Block Maximum Data
% The GEV can be defined constructively as the limiting distribution of block
% maxima (or minima).  That is, if you generate a large number of independent
% random values from a single probability distribution, and take their maximum
% value, the distribution of that maximum is approximately a GEV.

% The original distribution determines the shape parameter, k, of the
% resulting GEV distribution.  Distributions whose tails fall off as a
% polynomial, such as Student's t, lead to a positive shape parameter.
% Distributions whose tails decrease exponentially, such as the normal,
% correspond to a zero shape parameter.  Distributions with finite tails, such
% as the beta, correspond to a negative shape parameter.

%%
% Real applications for the GEV might include modelling the largest return
% for a stock during each month.  Here, we will simulate data by taking the
% maximum of 25 values from a Student's t distribution with two degrees of
% freedom.  The simulated data will include 75 random block maximum values.
rand('state',0'); randn('state',0);
y = max(trnd(2,25,75),[],1);


%% Fitting the Distribution by Maximum Likelihood
% The function |gevfit| returns both maximum likelihood parameter estimates,
% and (by default) 95% confidence intervals.
[paramEsts,paramCIs] = gevfit(y);

kMLE = paramEsts(1)        % Shape parameter
sigmaMLE = paramEsts(2)    % Scale parameter
muMLE = paramEsts(3)       % Location parameter
%%
kCI = paramCIs(:,1)
sigmaCI = paramCIs(:,2)
muCI = paramCIs(:,3)
%%
% Notice that the 95% confidence interval for k does not include the
% value zero. The type I extreme value distribution is apparently not a
% good model for these data.  That makes sense, because the underlying
% distribution for the simulation had much heavier tails than a normal, and
% the type II extreme value distribution is theoretically the correct one
% as the block size becomes large.

%%
% As an alternative to confidence intervals, we can also compute an
% approximation to the asymptotic covariance matrix of the parameter
% estimates, and from that extract the parameter standard errors.
[nll,acov] = gevlike(paramEsts,y);
paramSEs = sqrt(diag(acov))


%% Checking the Fit Visually
% To visually assess how good the fit is, we'll look at plots of the fitted
% probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF).
%
% The support of the GEV depends on the parameter values.  In this case, the
% estimate for k is positive, so the fitted distribution has zero probability
% below a lower bound.
lowerBnd = muMLE-sigmaMLE./kMLE;

%%
% First, we'll plot a scaled histogram of the data, overlayed with the
% PDF for the fitted GEV model.  This histogram is scaled so that the bar
% heights times their width sum to 1, to make it comparable to the PDF.

% by overlaying the empirical CDF and the fitted CDF.

%% Estimating Quantiles of the Model
% While the parameter estimates may be important by themselves, a quantile of
% the fitted GEV model is often the quantity of interest in analyzing block
% maxima data.
%
% For example, the return level Rm is defined as the block maximum value
% expected to be exceeded only once in m blocks.  That is just the (1-1/m)'th
% quantile. We can plug the maximum likelihood parameter estimates into the
% inverse CDF to estimate Rm for m=10.
R10MLE = gevinv(1-1./10,kMLE,sigmaMLE,muMLE)

%%
% We could compute confidence limits for R10 using asymptotic approximations,
% but those may not be valid.  Instead, we will use a likelihood-based method
% to compute confidence limits.  This method often produces more accurate
% results than one based on the estimated covariance matrix of the parameter
% estimates.
%
% Given any set of values for the parameters mu, sigma, and k, we can compute
% a log-likelihood REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH for example, the MLEs are the parameter values that
% maximize the GEV log-likelihood.  As the parameter values move away from the
% MLEs, their log-likelihood typically becomes significantly less than the
% maximum.  If we look at the set of parameter values that produce a
% log-likelihood larger than a specified critical value, this is a complicated
% region in the parameter space.  However, for a suitable critical value, it
% is a confidence region for the model parameters.  The region contains
% parameter values that are "compatible with the data".  The critical value
% that determines the region is based on a chi-square approximation, and we'll
% use 95% as our confidence level.  (Note that we will actually work with the
% negative of the log-likelihood.)
nllCritVal = gevlike([kMLE,sigmaMLE,muMLE],y) + .5*chi2inv(.95,1)

%%
% For any set of parameter values mu, sigma, and k, we can compute R10.
% Therefore, we can find the smallest R10 value achieved within the 
% critical region of the parameter space where the negative log-likelihood
% is larger than the critical value.  That smallest value is the lower
% likelihood-based confidence limit for R10.
%
% This is difficult to visualize in all three parameter dimensions, but as a
% thought experiment, we can fix the shape parameter, k, we can see how the
% procedure would work over the two remaining parameters, sigma and mu.

%% Likelihood Profile for a Quantile
% Sometimes just an interval does not give enough information about the
% quantity being estimated, and a profile likelihood is needed instead.  To
% find the log-likelihood profile for R10, we will fix a possible value for
% R10, and then maximize the GEV log-likelihood, with the parameters
% constrained so that they are consistent with that current value of R10. This
% is a nonlinear equality constraint.  If we do that over a range of R10
% values, we get a likelihood profile.
%
% As with the likelihood-based confidence interval, we can think about what
% this procedure would be if we fixed k and worked over the two remaining
% parameters, sigma and mu.  Each red contour line in the contour plot shown
% earlier represents a fixed value of R10; the profile likelihood optimization
% consists of stepping along a single R10 contour line to find the highest
% log-likelihood (blue) contour.
%
% For this example, we'll compute a profile likelihood for R10 over the values
% that were included in the likelihood confidence interval.

% anonymous function for the particular value of R10 under consideration.
% It also returns an empty value because we're not using any inequality
% constraints here.
%
% Finally, we'll call |fmincon| at each value of R10, to find the
% corresponding constrained maximum of the log-likelhood.  We'll start near
% the maximum likelihood estimate of R10, and work out in both directions.
