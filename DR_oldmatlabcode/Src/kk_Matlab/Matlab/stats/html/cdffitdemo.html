         <h1>Fitting a Univariate Distribution Using Cumulative Probabilities</h1>
         <introduction>
            <p>The most common method for fitting a univariate distribution to data is maximum likelihood.  But maximum likelihood does not
               work in all cases, and other estimation methods, such as the Method of Moments, are sometimes needed.  This demo describes
               another generally-applicable method for fitting univariate distributions that can be useful in cases when maximum likelihood
               fails, for example for some models that include a threshold parameter.  When applicable, maximum likelihood is probably the
               better choice of methods, because it is often more efficient.  But the method described here provides another tool that can
               be used when needed.

         <h2>Fitting an Exponential Distribution Using Least Squares<a name="1"></a></h2>
         <p>The term "least squares" is most commonly used in the context of fitting a regression line or surface to model a response
            variable as a function of one or more predictor variables.  The method described here is a very different application of least
            squares: univariate distribution fitting, with only a single variable.
         </p>
         <p>To demonstrate, first simulate some sample data.  We'll use an exponential distribution to generate the data.  For the purposes
            of this example, as in practice, we'll assume that the data are not known to have come from a particular model.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">rand(<span class="string">'state'</span>,0); randn(<span class="string">'state'</span>,0);
n = 100;
x = exprnd(2,n,1);
</pre><p>Next, compute the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of the data. This is simply a step function with a jump
            in cumulative probability, p, of 1/n at each data point, x.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">x = sort(x);
p = ((1:n)-0.5)' ./ n;
stairs(x,p,<span class="string">'k-'</span>);
xlabel(<span class="string">'x'</span>);
ylabel(<span class="string">'Cumulative probability (p)'</span>);
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="cdffitdemo_01.png"> <p>We'll fit an exponential distribution to these data.  One way to do that is to find the exponential distribution whose cumulative
            distribution function (CDF) best approximates (in a sense to be explained below) the ECDF of the data.  The exponential CDF
            is p = Pr{X &lt;= x} = 1 - exp(-x/mu).  Transforming that to -log(1-p)*mu = x gives a linear relationship between -log(1-p) and
            x.  If the data do come from an exponential, we ought to see, at least approximately, a linear relationship if we plug the
            computed x and p values from the ECDF into that equation.  If we use least squares to fit a straight line through the origin
            to x vs. -log(1-p), then that fitted line represents the exponential distribution that is "closest" to the data.  The slope
            of the line is an estimate of the parameter mu.
         </p>
         <p>Equivalently, we can think of y = -log(1-p) as an "idealized sample" from a standard (mean 1) exponential distribution. These
            idealized values are exactly equally spaced on the probability scale.  A Q-Q plot of x and y ought to be approximately linear
            if the data come from an exponential distribution, and we'll fit the least squares line through the origin to x vs. y.

            the values for y = -log(1-p) are deterministic, and it's the x values that are random.  It's also possible to regress y vs.
            x, or to use other types of linear fits, for example, weighted regression, orthogonal regression, or even robust regression.
            We will not explore those possibilities here.

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="cdffitdemo_05.png"> <h2>A Threshold Parameter Example<a name="13"></a></h2>
         <p>It's sometimes necessary to fit positive distributions like the Weibull or lognormal with a threshold parameter.  For example,
            a Weibull random variable takes values over (0,Inf), and a threshold parameter, c, shifts that range to (c,Inf).  If the threshold
            parameter is known, then there is no difficulty.  But if the threshold parameter is not known, it must instead be estimated.
             These models are difficult to fit with maximum likelihood -- the likelihood can have multiple modes, or even become infinite
            for parameter values that are not reasonable for the data, and so maximum likelihood is often not a good method.  But with
            a small addition to the least squares procedure, we can get stable estimates.
         </p>
         <p>To illustrate, we'll simulate some data from a three-parameter Weibull distribution, with a threshold value.  As above, we'll
            assume for the purposes of the example that the data are not known to have come from a particular model, and that the threshold
            is not known.

            parameters.

             On the other hand, the plots for 2 and 3 differ more systematically from linear, which is evidence that those values are

         <p>The exponential distribution is a scale family, and on the log scale, the Weibull distribution is a location-scale family,
            so this least squares method was straightforward in those two cases.  The general procedure to fit a location-scale distribution
            is
         </p>
         <div>
            <ul>
               <li>Compute the ECDF of the observed data.</li>
               <li>Transform the distribution's CDF to get a linear relationship between some function of the data and some function of the cumulative
                  probability.  These two functions do not involve the distribution parameters, but the slope and intercept of the line do.
               </li>
               <li>Plug the values of x and p from the ECDF into that transformed CDF, and fit a straight line using least squares.</li>
               <li>Solve for the distribution parameters in terms of the slope and intercept of the line.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>We also saw that fitting a distribution that is a location-scale family with an additional a threshold parameter is only slightly
            more difficult.
         </p>
         <p>But other distributions that are not location-scale families, like the gamma, are a bit tricker.  There's no transformation
            of the CDF that will give a relationship that is linear.  However, we can use a similar idea, only this time working on the
            untransformed cumulative probability scale.  A P-P plot is the appropriate way to visualize that fitting procedure.
         </p>
         <p>If the empirical probabilities from the ECDF are plotted against fitted probabilities from a parametric model, a tight scatter
            along the 1:1 line from zero to one indicates that the parameter values define a distribution that explains the observed data
            well, because the fitted CDF approximates the empirical CDF well.  The idea is to find parameter values that make the probability
            plot as close to the 1:1 line as possible.  That may not even be possible, if the distribution is not a good model for the
            data.  If the P-P plot shows a systematic departure from the 1:1 line, then the model may be questionable.  However, it's
            important to remember that since the points in these plots are not independent, interpretion is not exactly the same as a
            regression residual plot.
         </p>

            is not very good -- the probabilities from the parametric CDF are not close to the probabilities from the ECDF.  If we tried
            a different a and b, we'd get a different scatter on the P-P plot, with a different discrepancy from the 1:1 line. Since we
            know the true a and b in this example, we'll try those values.

            lognormal model.  The likelihood for such a model is unbounded, and so maximum likelihood does not work.  However, the least
            squares method provides a way to make estimates.  Since the two-parameter lognormal distribution can be log-transformed to
            a location-scale family, we could follow the same steps as in the earlier example that demonstrated fitting a Weibull distribution
            with threshold parameter.  Here, however, we'll do the estimation on the cumulative probability scale, as in the previous
            example demonstrating a fit with the gamma distribution.

%% Fitting a Univariate Distribution Using Cumulative Probabilities
% The most common method for fitting a univariate distribution to data is
% maximum likelihood.  But maximum likelihood does not work in all cases, and
% other estimation methods, such as the Method of Moments, are sometimes
% needed.  This demo describes another generally-applicable method for fitting
% univariate distributions that can be useful in cases when maximum likelihood
% fails, for example for some models that include a threshold parameter.  When
% applicable, maximum likelihood is probably the better choice of methods,
% because it is often more efficient.  But the method described here provides
% another tool that can be used when needed.

%% Fitting an Exponential Distribution Using Least Squares
% The term "least squares" is most commonly used in the context of fitting a
% regression line or surface to model a response variable as a function of one
% or more predictor variables.  The method described here is a very different
% application of least squares: univariate distribution fitting, with only a
% single variable.
%
% To demonstrate, first simulate some sample data.  We'll use an exponential
% distribution to generate the data.  For the purposes of this example, as in
% practice, we'll assume that the data are not known to have come from a
% particular model.
rand('state',0); randn('state',0);
n = 100;
x = exprnd(2,n,1);

%%
% Next, compute the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of the
% data. This is simply a step function with a jump in cumulative probability,
% p, of 1/n at each data point, x.
x = sort(x);
p = ((1:n)-0.5)' ./ n;
stairs(x,p,'k-');
xlabel('x');
ylabel('Cumulative probability (p)');

%%
% We'll fit an exponential distribution to these data.  One way to do that is
% to find the exponential distribution whose cumulative distribution function
% (CDF) best approximates (in a sense to be explained below) the ECDF of the
% data.  The exponential CDF is p = Pr{X <= x} = 1 - exp(-x/mu).  Transforming
% that to -log(1-p)*mu = x gives a linear relationship between -log(1-p) and
% x.  If the data do come from an exponential, we ought to see, at least
% approximately, a linear relationship if we plug the computed x and p values
% from the ECDF into that equation.  If we use least squares to fit a straight
% line through the origin to x vs. -log(1-p), then that fitted line represents
% the exponential distribution that is "closest" to the data.  The slope of
% the line is an estimate of the parameter mu.
%
% Equivalently, we can think of y = -log(1-p) as an "idealized sample" from a
% standard (mean 1) exponential distribution. These idealized values are
% exactly equally spaced on the probability scale.  A Q-Q plot of x and y
% ought to be approximately linear if the data come from an exponential
% distribution, and we'll fit the least squares line through the origin to x
% vs. y.
y = -log(1 - p);
muHat = y \ x

%%
% Plot the data and the fitted line.
plot(x,y,'+', y*muHat,y,'rREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH');
xlabel('x');
ylabel('y = -log(1-p)');
%%
% Notice that the linear fit we've made minimizes the sum of squared errors in
% the horizontal, or "x", direction.  That's because the values for y =
% -log(1-p) are deterministic, and it's the x values that are random.  It's
% also possible to regress y vs. x, or to use other types of linear fits, for
% example, weighted regression, orthogonal regression, or even robust
% regression. We will not explore those possibilities here.

%%
% For comparison, fit the data by maximum likelihood.
muMLE = expfit(x)

%%
% Now plot the two estimated distributions on the untransformed cumulative
% probability scale.
stairs(x,p,'k-');
hold on
xgrid = linspace(0,1.1*max(x),100)';

legend({'Data','LS Fit','ML Fit'},'location','southeast');
%%
% The two methods give very similar fitted distributions, although the LS fit
% has been influenced more by observations in the tail of the distribution.


%% Fitting a Weibull Distribution
% For a slightly more complex example, simulate some sample data from a
% Weibull distribution, and compute the ECDF of x.
n = 100;
x = wblrnd(2,1,n,1);
x = sort(x);
p = ((1:n)-0.5)' ./ n;

%%
% To fit a Weibull distribution to these data, notice that the CDF for the
% Weibull is p = Pr{X <= x} = 1 - exp(-(x/a)^b). Transforming that to log(a) +
% log(-log(1-p))*(1/b) = log(x) again gives a linear relationship, this time
% between log(-log(1-p)) and log(x).  We can use least squares to fit a
% straight line on the transformed scale using p and x from the ECDF, and the
% slope and intercept of that line lead to estimates of a and b.
logx = log(x);
logy = log(-log(1 - p));
poly = polyfit(logy,logx,1);
paramHat = [exp(poly(2)) 1/poly(1)]

%%
% Plot the data and the fitted line on the transformed scale.
plot(logx,logy,'+', log(paramHat(1)) + logy/paramHat(2),logy,'rREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH');
xlabel('log(x)');
ylabel('log(-log(1-p))');

%%
% For comparison, fit the data by maximum likelihood, and plot the two
% estimated distributions on the untransformed scale.
paramMLE = wblfit(x)
stairs(x,p,'k');
hold on
xgrid = linspace(0,1.1*max(x),100)';
plot(xgrid,wblcdf(xgrid,paramHat(1),paramHat(2)),'rREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH', ...
     xgrid,wblcdf(xgrid,paramMLE(1),paramMLE(2)),'bREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH');

%% A Threshold Parameter Example
% It's sometimes necessary to fit positive distributions like the Weibull or
% lognormal with a threshold parameter.  For example, a Weibull random
% variable takes values over (0,Inf), and a threshold parameter, c, shifts
% that range to (c,Inf).  If the threshold parameter is known, then there is
% no difficulty.  But if the threshold parameter is not known, it must instead
% be estimated.  These models are difficult to fit with maximum likelihood REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH
% the likelihood can have multiple modes, or even become infinite for
% parameter values that are not reasonable for the data, and so maximum
% likelihood is often not a good method.  But with a small addition to the
% least squares procedure, we can get stable estimates.
%
% To illustrate, we'll simulate some data from a three-parameter Weibull
% distribution, with a threshold value.  As above, we'll assume for the
% purposes of the example that the data are not known to have come from a
% particular model, and that the threshold is not known.
n = 100;
x = wblrnd(4,2,n,1) + 4;
hist(x,20); xlim([0 16]);

%%
% How can we fit a three-parameter Weibull distribution to these data?  If we
% knew what the threshold value was, 1 for example, we could subtract that
% value from the data and then use the least squares procedure to estimate the
% Weibull shape and scale parameters.
x = sort(x);
p = ((1:n)-0.5)' ./ n;
logy = log(-log(1-p));
logxm1 = log(x-1);
poly1 = polyfit(log(-log(1-p)),log(x-1),1);
paramHat1 = [exp(poly1(2)) 1/poly1(1)]
plot(logxm1,logy,'b+', log(paramHat1(1)) + logy/paramHat1(2),logy,'rREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH');
xlabel('log(x-1)');
ylabel('log(-log(1-p))');

%%
% That's not a very good fit REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH log(x-1) and log(-log(1-p)) do not have a
% linear relationship.  Of course, that's because we don't know the correct
% threshold value.  If we try subtracting different threshold values, we get
% different plots and different parameter estimates.

% The relationship between log(x-4) and log(-log(1-p)) appears approximately
% linear.  Since we'd expect to see an approximately linear plot if we
% subtracted the true threshold parameter, this is evidence that 4 might be a
% reasonable value for the threshold.  On the other hand, the plots for 2 and
% 3 differ more systematically from linear, which is evidence that those
% values are not consistent with the data.
%
% This argument can be formalized.  For each provisional value of the
% threshold parameter, the corresponding provisional Weibull fit can be
% characterized as the parameter values that maximize the R^2 value of a
% linear regression on the transformed variables log(x-c) and log(-log(1-p)).
% To estimate the threshold parameter, we can carry that one step further, and
% maximize the R^2 value over all possible threshold values.

%% Non-Location-Scale Families
% The exponential distribution is a scale family, and on the log scale, the
% Weibull distribution is a location-scale family, so this least squares
% method was straightforward in those two cases.  The general procedure to
% fit a location-scale distribution is
%
% * Compute the ECDF of the observed data.
% * Transform the distribution's CDF to get a linear relationship between
% some function of the data and some function of the cumulative
% probability.  These two functions do not involve the distribution
% parameters, but the slope and intercept of the line do.
% * Plug the values of x and p from the ECDF into that transformed CDF,
% and fit a straight line using least squares.
% * Solve for the distribution parameters in terms of the slope and
% intercept of the line.
%
% We also saw that fitting a distribution that is a location-scale family
% with an additional a threshold parameter is only slightly more difficult.
%
% But other distributions that are not location-scale families, like the
% gamma, are a bit tricker.  There's no transformation of the CDF that will
% give a relationship that is linear.  However, we can use a similar idea,
% only this time working on the untransformed cumulative probability scale.  A
% P-P plot is the appropriate way to visualize that fitting procedure.
%
% If the empirical probabilities from the ECDF are plotted against fitted
% probabilities from a parametric model, a tight scatter along the 1:1 line
% from zero to one indicates that the parameter values define a distribution
% that explains the observed data well, because the fitted CDF approximates
% the empirical CDF well.  The idea is to find parameter values that make the
% probability plot as close to the 1:1 line as possible.  That may not even be
% possible, if the distribution is not a good model for the data.  If the P-P
% plot shows a systematic departure from the 1:1 line, then the model may be
% questionable.  However, it's important to remember that since the points in
% these plots are not independent, interpretion is not exactly the same as a
% regression residual plot.
%
% For example, we'll simulate some data and fit a gamma distribution.
n = 100;
x = gamrnd(2,1,n,1);

% Compute the ECDF of x.
x = sort(x);
pEmp = ((1:n)-0.5)' ./ n;

%%
% We can make a probability plot using any initial guess for the gamma
% distribution's parameters, a=1 and b=1, say.  That guess is not very good REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH
% the probabilities from the parametric CDF are not close to the probabilities
% from the ECDF.  If we tried a different a and b, we'd get a different
% scatter on the P-P plot, with a different discrepancy from the 1:1 line.
% Since we know the true a and b in this example, we'll try those values.
a0 = 1; b0 = 1;
p0Fit = gamcdf(x,a0,b0);
a1 = 2; b1 = 1;

%%
% The second set of values for a and b make for a much better plot, and thus
% are more compatible with the data, if you are measuring "compatible" by how
% straight you can make the P-P plot.
%
% To make the scatter match the 1:1 line as closely possible, we can find the
% values of a and b that minimize a weighted sum of the squared distances to
% the 1:1 line.  The weights are defined in terms of the empirical
% probabilities, and are lowest in the center of the plot and highest at the
% extremes.  These weights compensate for the variance of the fitted
% probabilities, which is highest near the median and lowest in the tails.
% This weighted least squares procedure defines the estimator for a and b.

% Notice that in the location-scale cases considered earlier, we could fit the
% distribution with a single straight line fit.  Here, as with the threshold

%% A Lognormal Threshold Parameter Example
% The lognormal distribution is simple to fit by maximum likelihood, because
% once the log transformation is applied to the data, maximum likelihood is

% is unbounded, and so maximum likelihood does not work.  However, the least
% squares method provides a way to make estimates.  Since the two-parameter
% lognormal distribution can be log-transformed to a location-scale family, we
% could follow the same steps as in the earlier example that demonstrated
% fitting a Weibull distribution with threshold parameter.  Here, however,
% we'll do the estimation on the cumulative probability scale, as in the
% previous example demonstrating a fit with the gamma distribution.
%
% To illustrate, we'll simulate some data from a three-parameter lognormal
% distribution, with a threshold.

% bootstrap standard error estimates.  These do not make any parametric

% The bootstrap standard errors are not far off from the Monte-Carlo
% calculations. That's not surprising, since the fitted model is the same one
% from which the example data were generated.

%% Summary
% The fitting method described here is an alternative to maximum likelihood
% that can be used to fit univariate distributions when maximum likelihood
% fails to provide useful parameter estimates.  One important application is
% in fitting distributions involving a threshold parameter, such as the
% three-parameter lognormal.  Standard errors are more difficult to compute
% than for maximum likelihood estimates, because analytic approximations do
% not exist, but simulation provides a feasible alternative.
%
% The P-P plots used here to illustrate the fitting method are useful in their
% own right, as a visual indication of lack of fit when fitting a univariate
% distribution.
